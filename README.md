This app is the product of a school project.
This is a prototype app focused on providing a platform between a counsellor and their clients. This allows for easy and quality communication between these two parties.

This app is mainly focused on peer to peer help where anyone in the community can help others or receive help. It also have professionals to help during extreme cases. We ensure that everyone's privacy is respected by allowing a choice for users to remain anonymous and there will be no need for any personal information to be given. We also ensure that any toxicity will be removed as soon as possible to protect everyonesâ€™ safety.
